This plugin is developed for my own use, and not registered to Obsidian Community plugins. If you're interested, use [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) to install this plugin.

## Settings
### Default Width
Set the default width for pasted image.
### Default Height
Set the default height for pasted image (Use zero to disable this option).

## Note
If errors occured when you paste bunch of image at once, switch the editor to source mode to prevent errors.

## Credits
This plugin's starting point was [obsidian-paste-image-rename](https://github.com/reorx/obsidian-paste-image-rename/blob/master/src/main.ts) by reorx. Thanks for the amazing work!
